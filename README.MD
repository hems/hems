### Hello 👋

I'm have been writting code since 1997 and using git since 2008. 

In those 25+ years i have played with a lot of programming languages and used them to develop websites, desktop and mobile applications, physical installations, music, spatial audio installations, three-d graphics, web3 contracts, open source software and likely other things i have already forgotten.

I hope you enjoy some of the code you will find here, unfortunately though it's a bit of a mess as i haven't been publishing or contributing to github repositoris in a long time.

If you feel like getting in touch please go ahead - you can get my details on the sidebar.

✌️
