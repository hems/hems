### Hello 👋

I've been writing code since 1997 and using Git since 2008.

Over those 25+ years, I've worked with a wide range of programming languages, building everything from websites, desktop apps, and mobile applications to physical installations, music software, spatial audio systems, 3D graphics, and web3 contracts (plus plenty of other things I've  forgotten by now).

I hope you find something useful or interesting here. I'm not gonna lie: it's a bit of a mess, as I haven't been actively publishing or contributing to public GitHub repos in a while.

Feel free to get in touch! you'll find my details in the sidebar.

✌️
