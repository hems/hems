### Hello üëã

I'm have been writting code since 1997 and using git since 2008. 

In those 25 years i have played with a lot of programming languages and used them to develop websites, "desktop software", installations, music, three-d graphics, web3 contracts, OSS and likely other things i have already forgotten.

Unfortunately github stats won't show stats for a lot of the private repos i worked so my stats don't reflect how much i have typed in the last decade ( :

I hope you enjoy some of the code you will find here or some of my contributions on github.

If you feel like getting in touch please go ahead ( you can get my details on the left side of my profile ).
